# 15-112 Term Project
OpenCV Agar: My 15-112 term project is a reimagining of the popular multiplayer game agar.io, 
in which you control your own dot as it moves throughout a map full of enemies. The goal is to 
gain size by eating smaller dots while avoiding larger dots that try to eat you. In this take on 
the game, user-controlled dots follow the playerâ€™s hand motion, which is recorded by your webcam, 
and enemy dots are controlled by an algorithm that makes decisions based on the size and distance 
of dots around them.
