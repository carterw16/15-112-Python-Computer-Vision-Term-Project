# 15-112 Term Project
OpenCV Agar: My 15-112 term project is a reimagining of the popular multiplayer game agar.io, 
in which a player controls a dot in a map full of enemy dots and the goal is to gain size by eating 
food and smaller dots while avoiding larger dots that try to eat you. In this take on the game, 
user-controlled dots follow the playerâ€™s hand motion, which is recorded by your webcam, and enemy dots 
are controlled by an algorithm that makes decisions based on the size and distance of other dots around them.
